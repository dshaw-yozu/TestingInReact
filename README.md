# Testing in react

## Contents

1 incomplete implementation of a simple calculator. It takes 2 numbers and an operator and returns the result on screen in real time. There is also a reset button which clears the inputs and operator selector.


## Plan

* Start off with the basics and setup some tests for a simple set of arithmetic functions (Unit Tests)
* Move onto testing React components (Component Tests)
* Look into Playwright for Acceptance tests


## Unit Tests

Add to and improve the tests within: src/utils/operations.test.js

## Component Tests

Fix and improve the tests within src/components/Button.test.jsx.
Add tests to the other components, probably in this order: Input -> Select -> Calculator

## Acceptance Tests with Playwright

Follow the Getting Started instructions https://playwright.dev/docs/intro and add series of acceptance tests proving the full functionality of the calculator
